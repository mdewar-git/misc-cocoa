# `misc-cocoa` 

A collection of personal bits and pieces. 

## Overview  

This repository contains small experiments and code samples for learning and experimenting with Mac software development.

It is mostly focused on **programmatic macOS app development** using Cocoa/AppKit.

The goal is to learn to build tools for the Mac entirely through code (without relying on Nib files, Storyboards, or Interface Builder).

### **Current Contents**  

#### `main.swift`  

This file demonstrates how to **set up a Cocoa application programmatically**:  

- Initializes the `NSApplication` instance that represents the running app.
- Assigns a delegate to manage the app's lifecycle events.
- Starts the run loop.

This example provides a barebones entry point for a Mac app.
