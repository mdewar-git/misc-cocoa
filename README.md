# **misc-cocoa**  
A collection of personal bits and pieces. 

## Overview  
This repository contains small experiments and code samples for learning and experimenting with Mac software development.

It is mostly focused on **programmatic macOS app development** using Cocoa/AppKit.

The goal is to learn to build tools for the Mac entirely through code (without relying on Nib files, Storyboards, or Interface Builder).

### **Current Contents**  

#### `main.swift`  
This file demonstrates how to **set up a Cocoa application programmatically**:  
- **Initializes** the `NSApplication` instance that represents the running app.  
- **Assigns a delegate** to manage the app's lifecycle events.  
- **Starts the run loop** to handle system events and keep the app responsive.

This example provides a barebones **entry point** for a macOS application (that does not rely on any visual tools like Nib files or Interface Builder).
